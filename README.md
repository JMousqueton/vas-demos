# Veeam Availability Suite clickable demos

These demos are created to help in showing the features available in the Veeam Availability Suite. They can be used at events, partners, customers,... and will show how easy to use the Veeam Availability Suite is.

From the index select a specific feature and just click on the boxes to proceed to the next (or previous) step. Once finished it will return to the global index. By clicking on the upper logo the whole index page will refresh.

All demos are fully HTML5 and therefor don't require Flash or Silverlight to work.
